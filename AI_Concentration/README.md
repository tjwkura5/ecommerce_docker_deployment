# Fraud Detection in E-Commerce Transactions: A DevOps Team's Approach to ML Integration

## Business Scenario

The e-commerce DevOps team is exploring the implementation of a machine learning model to provide automatic insights into identifying fraudulent transactions on the platform. With an increasing number of transactions, detecting anomalies manually has become inefficient. The team is considering three models for anomaly detection:

- **Isolation Forests**: A tree-based model that isolates anomalies efficiently.
- **Clustering with DBSCAN**: A density-based clustering approach that identifies regions of high density and isolates points in sparse regions as anomalies.
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks designed to reconstruct input data, where anomalies result in higher reconstruction errors.

The goal is to evaluate these models, compare their performance, and decide on the most effective approach to integrate into the application.  

## Instructions

### Steps to Complete

1. **Deploy the Application**  
   Deploy the provided application and ensure that the database is properly set up with the `account_stripemodel` table containing transaction data.  

2. **Connect to the Database**  
   Connect to the database using any method of your choice (e.g., Python with `sqlite3`, `psycopg2`, or database GUI tools).  

3. **Run and Observe the Models**  
   - Execute each of the three ML models (Isolation Forests, DBSCAN, Autoencoders) to identify anomalies in the transactions.  
   - Analyze the initial outputs:
     - **Isolation Forest**: Identified 151 anomalies.
     - **DBSCAN**: Identified 2 anomalies.
     - **Autoencoder**: Identified 30 anomalies.   
   - Adjust the anomaly detection thresholds and observe how each model's performance changes.  

4. **Select One Model**  
   Based on your observations, choose the model you believe is the most effective for this task. Justify your selection with logical reasoning.  

5. **Tune the Model**  
   - Preprocess the transaction data using libraries like `pandas` and `sklearn`.  
   - If necessary, add labels for supervised learning or experiment with unsupervised settings.  
   - Modify model parameters (e.g., contamination for Isolation Forest, epsilon for DBSCAN, architecture for Autoencoders) to improve performance.  

6. **Test on New Data**  
   - Use the additional dataset provided in `account_stripemodel_fraud_data.csv` to validate the model's effectiveness on unseen data.  

7. **Document Your Work**  
   - Add a new section in your repository's `README.md` file titled **AI Model**.
   - Document the following:

- **Steps Taken**  
   Describe how you connected to the database, ran the models, and analyzed their outputs. Explain the preprocessing steps performed.

- **Model Selection**  
   Explain which model you chose and why. Provide logical reasoning (e.g., model performance, interpretability, or ease of integration).  

- **Tuning and Testing**  
   Detail the tuning process, including any adjustments to parameters or preprocessing steps. Explain why these changes were necessary and how they improved the model's accuracy or robustness.  

- **Results**  
   Summarize the final performance of the model on both the training and testing datasets, including any metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 score). Discuss the effectiveness of the model in detecting anomalies.

- **Integration into Application UI**  
   Propose how this model could be integrated into the current application UI for admins.
